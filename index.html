    <h2>Story of my life</h2>
    <P>
        <ul>
            <li>My name is Stean Heta.</li>
            <li>l am a female of 17 turning 18 years in March 9th .</li>
            <li>l am an extrovert and genuinely weird but l love my personaliy as it makes me unique.</li>
            <li>l am a lover of nature since young and specifically the animals.
            <li>l am a lover of music and l love to listen to music.</li>
<p>Genuinely l see that every animal represented here has a significant role it plays in displaying life</p>

<h3>The butterfly</h3>

<ul>
    <li>It signifies the beauty of life and where there is always freedom</li>
    <li>It is a symbol of transformation and change</li>
    <li>It finally symbolises the importance of accepting the beauty of everything despite the changes</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Tiger</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The tiger signifies independence and leadership and to me it shows just how much being alone can change a person</li>
    <li>It also signifies mystery and intuition showcasing the ability to achieve wonder without announcing the process</li>
    <li>And finally it shows strength and power that is within all of us without a doubt</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The mystique wolf</h3>
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSAIYUHlIefCByJfhF5po_htRsi3F2J-Zbuxw&s" class="image" alt="The wolf">
    <li>The wolf is among the strangest but best animals l would want to associate with.</li>
    <li>They are not only intelligent and cunning but also showcase a great deal of strength</li>
    <li>The trait l love the most about them is their loyalty and respect to hiersrchy and amazing family bonds.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The reason l have given these examples is that l personally despite not all every trait showcased by the animals plays a significant role in human life. And by that alone it is important to know where you belong every person has a personality similar to an animal and these traits bring out the best in our personlaities one way or the other</p>
<div>
<h3>Music</h3>
<ul>
    <li>l believe music is remedy to the soul</li>
    <li>Not only that but it the music language transcends boundaries in countless ways</li>
    <li>Personally l believe that music does wonders that no one can expect</li>
    <li>It is a language that speaks to the soul and brings out the best in us</li>
</ul>
